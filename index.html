                    I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at UMass Amherst, having completed a dual degree (undergraduate and master's) at IIT Madras. With a strong foundation in advanced courses such as Advanced NLP, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning, my academic journey has been complemented by practical experience as a quantitative analyst at Morgan Stanley for two years. My expertise spans Python, mathematics, data science, and large language models (LLMs). As a graduate student researcher at Meta, I contributed to devising quantifiable metrics to measure bias in image generative models. I am actively seeking Fall or Spring Co-ops in machine learning and LLM-related roles, where I can leverage my comprehensive skills and experience.

                <div class="about-text">
                    In addition to my academic and professional background, I have co-founded and developed innovative products like leapp.ai and knibble.ai, which gained significant traction with over 5,000 user sign-ups within the first two months. These startups showcase my ability to blend technical prowess with entrepreneurial acumen, creating impactful solutions that resonate with users. My experience in building scalable and user-centric applications underscores my suitability for roles in hedge funds and LLM-driven industries, where cutting-edge technology and data-driven decision-making are paramount.
